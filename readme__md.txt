Purpose of this repo
  Improve my c++ skill by practice UE5 examples, since it's exciting to me
    - Promote C++ over Blueprints.
    - Promote written tutorials over video tutorials.
  
  Help to make video tutorials better
    Please read below, of you feel addressed by this.

  Evolve a collection of "tutorials" that are not video tutorials
    I intend to learn a bit UE5, and document the learning results, basically just for me as
    a summary and an overview.
  
    I share this here with you, in case you like the idea, it may be useful to you, you can make suggestions, ...
  
    Who knows, maybe it can evolve into a nice place for UE5 text tutorials.
  
Problems with video tutorials
  For video tutorial creators, I name the problems I see, it's all personal, no offence, you do a
  great job. It could just be so much better in some cases, and even without effort, just
  by paying attention, and sometimes even with LESS effort. So here ar the major problems I see, 
  in order of severity ( please don't get upset ) **Just my personal opinion** :



  Background music problem

    This is the worst of all. How Can I focus at peak, peak, peak, if I am "forced" to split my
    attention to consume music ? This is  totally not adequate studying for me. I can care myself
    about my mood.
    
    Anyone can put any music whatsoever, if he likes, but those who prefer silence can't "turn
    the music off".
    
    I understand the intent to paint the videos with some "mood", but it is enforced, and I don't 
    see any added value in this. 
    
    **World, can you for heavens sake stop this. It is an advertisement
    method, not a teachnig method.**

  Mouse wiggling problem

    This is the second most terrible thing that is so useless and can be fixed effortlessly,
    as the one above.
    People point at someting on the ide-guy, say "this, over here", and wiggle the mouse
    as an effort to direct the audiences attention over there.
    Animals with a reptile brain have the compulsion to follow moving images, but compare,
    of you point at something with the finger, like "where's the main station" - "that way"; 
    are you wiggling with your finger ? No.
    So please: **If you point something out using the mouse pointer, please don't wiggle !**
    Just calmly point at it.
    A tip here: Chane the mouse pointer appearence to use a large pointer in a signal color,
    like big yellow if you use a dark theme, or dark blue if you use a light theme.
    
  Wrong pace / no rest points problem
        
    Missed something ? Want to repeat ? The navi-bar just dont have the resolution to repeat
    on a fine grain, if the video is > 30 min. Also, sometimes the stream is broken or stalled
    after doing this. In short: The pace can't be adjusted to the audience. Everyone has a
    different speed, this is disregarded.

  No structure, just detail problem

    Many vieos of the type "how to do xy" are > 30 mins, even > 60 often, and have
    detail, detail, detail, click here, do this, switch over here, ... and no structure
    like "setting up this" "preparing that", and also, often it is in a counter-intuitive
    squence. **Books, written texts, have structure, because this helps mental processing !**

  Unpleasent intonation problem

    A good voice actor make breaks, speaks in a pleasent speed and relaxed, soft, clearly.
    It is enjoyable to liten to a good voice actor.
    Video tutorial speakers are sometimes the total opposite ! Nervous, hectic, ...
    People speak too fast, with a too strong dialect, not clearly, stuttering sometimes.
    Some people even shorten sentences bu cutting out the "gaps" between words.
    Very unpleasent to listen to. Worse than a robot voice.
      
  Bad resolution problem

    Oftenly, I see mouse rushing over the IDE doing this and that and I just can'y easily
    following this, because the text ( filenames, variable names ...) is blurry because of resolution.
    ( People use a high resolution on the recorded video, which I can't reproduce ).

  **conclusion**

    While creating video tutorials instead of written ones is time saving for the creator, 
    it is on the other hand time consuming for the 
    audience. And this is more time wasted as the audience grows.

  The struggle with blueprints

    This is why I prefer c++ over blueprints:

      - Information density: One page is needed for something that can be expressed in 5 lines of code. navigation is difficult
        
      - revision control, how to diff ? 

      - How to resue "code" without copy paste ?

      - commenting is not convenient

      - Blocks change relative size on zooming !?

So, that's it. That brought me to create this project.
      
Usage / contribution

  Each example should have it's own branch, so that all changes of the example can be seen
  bu comparing the branch root to the branch tip.
  Each example branch should merge back to master. If an example is improved, that should be
  a NEW BRANCH, to keep the original example seperated from the improvement.
  
  Each example must have a unique name that is then used as file name, folder name, and git
  branch name.
  
  Each example should have a sub-folder in the assets and sources, and under docs/examples.
  
  To contribute, just fork, branch, pull request, and follow the above.
